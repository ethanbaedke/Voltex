# Voltex
Currently, the Voltex Engine only supports Windows(x64) and build settings are only set for Visual Studio

# Build Instructions
1) Download and unzip the repository on your Window(x64) machine
2) Run the CleanBuildProject.bat file
3) Open the generated Voltex.sln file
4) Right click the VoltexGame project and select "Set as Startup Project"

You can now build and run the project. The main.cpp file in the VoltexGame project holds example code showing how to create and use custom game objects.
